# stats_js
Most statistical packages written for javascript seems to be pre-tensorflow and pre-ES6. While I was hoping someone else would write a stats package for javascript similar to R or sklearn in python, but now it looks like I'm the guy.

Google released tensorflow.js and after 2 years it looks like they're sticking to it. I implement the following statistical methods using tensorflow.js primitives 

* Logistic Regression
* Generalized Linear Regression
* Support Vector Machines
* Survival Analysis
* Gaussian Mixture Models


Technical Analysis indicators
* McClellan Summation Index
* 

Tested on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers.
